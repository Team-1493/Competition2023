# Robot
Robots are cool, don't you think? this is why I, John Robot have created this repository here for everyone to add their robot code to.

# Tips 
Did you know that gradlew.bat is responsible for the entire compilation and build proccess? Add anything to the file to customize your building experience.

Need an excuse for slacking off? Simply put `timeout 1000` at the start of your gradlew.bat file. Whenever anyone asks what you're doing, just say that you're waiting for the robot code to build and show the screen. Additionally, you can edit this readme file, which will make it look like you're typing.
